CGPA (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how our app, a native mobile application designed to help students compute and track their cumulative grade point average (CGPA) for undergraduate and master’s level education, handles user data.

## 1. Information We Collect

We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from our users. The app does not require you to create an account or provide any personal data to access its features.

## 2. Data Usage

All calculations, inputs, and results are processed locally on your device. None of the data you enter into the app is transmitted, stored, or shared with us or any third parties.

## 3. Third-Party Services

This app does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics tools, or advertising platforms. As a result, no external entities have access to any data from the app.

## 4. User Accounts

No sign-up, login, or account creation is required to use the app. All features of the app are fully accessible without restrictions or conditions.

## 5. Data Security

While we do not collect any data, we prioritize providing a safe user experience. Any data you input remains solely on your device and is not accessible to us or others.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

This app is intended for use by students of all ages. As no data is collected or shared, it complies with child privacy regulations, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated Privacy Policy, which will be made available within the app. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.
